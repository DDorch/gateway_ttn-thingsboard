# GateWay_TTNThingsboard
This script allows you to receive messages published on MQTT topic, 
select data, and publish this data via HTTP request.
the script is developed to work between The Things Network and Things Board. 
The ThingsBoard Professional Edition  of Things Board allows you to read a Topic MQTT directly and a Gateway module 
is available to do the same.
